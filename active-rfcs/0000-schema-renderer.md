## Summary

Render vuetify elements tree with a JSON description.
With dynamic property binding between components, event propagating,
and dynamic property interpolation like v-for, v-model, v-show

## Basic example

```js
<temaplte>
    <v-schema-renderer :children="schema" />
</template>

<script>
export default {
    data: vm => ({
        schema: [
            {
                tag: 'VCard',
                props: {
                    color: 'red'
                },
                children: [
                    {
                        tag: 'VCardTitle',
                        children: '$.decorat("Hi {0}", $.bindings.firstname)',
                    },
                    {
                        tag: 'VCardBody',
                        children: [
                            {
                                tag: 'VTextField',
                                'v-model': '$.bindings.firstname',
                                props: {
                                    label: 'Enter your name'
                                },
                            },
                            {
                                tag: 'VTextField',
                                'v-model': '$.bindings.count',
                                props: {
                                    label: 'Enter a number between 1 and 10'
                                    type: 'number',
                                },
                            },
                        ],
                    }
                    {
                        tag: 'VCardBody',
                        children: [
                            {
                                tag: 'VList',
                                children: [
                                    {
                                        tag: 'VListItem',
                                        'v-for': '$.bindings.count',
                                        children: [
                                            {
                                                tag: 'VListItemTitle',
                                                children: '$.decorat("List item {0}", $.args[0])'
                                            }
                                        ]
                                    }
                                ]
                            },
                        ],
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    })
}
</script>
```

## Motivation

I wanted to render dynamically generated JSON pages with Vuetify.
This component makes JSON parsing & rendering of components native to Vuetify framework.

## Detailed design

The component accepts a children property (an array of JSON descriptive properties of components) and renders those components with their respective properties. It includes some smart properties as well, for example support for v-for,v-show,v-model directives & automatice 2 way value bindings & event handling.

## Drawbacks

Why is this change necessary? What does it improve within the framework?

- A new component called VSchemaRenderer
- A set of new types for VSchemaRenderer
- The VSchemaRenderer needs to call js "eval" function
- Togather this component with SchemaBuilder makes a UI Editor for Vuetify
- Togather this component with JsonEditor makes a UI Editor for custom schemed JSON files
- Does not break anything

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?
You need to develop a new component to render json schemas.

## Adoption strategy

If this proposal is implemented, please consider the following:

- What steps would existing Vuetify users need to take in order to upgrade their project?
    upgrade vuetify.
- How does this RFC affect projects in the Vuetify ecosystem?
    no affect on internal structure of other components
- Can we implement a change into [eslint-plugin-vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/eslint-plugin-vuetify)

## Unresolved questions

If applicable, what aspects of this proposal are still TBD?
